Diabolo sizes:
Red: 127 mm diameter, 144 mm height
Green: 82 mm diameter, 94 mm height
Bluewhite: 99 mm diameter, 115 mm height


During calibration, the sticks were held so that the tip was close to the origin (but likely shifted about 4 mm above (z) and blocked by the other stick.
The diabolos were placed such that the center was above the origin of the ground plane.

The y-axis of the world coordinate system was pointing towards the cameras. The diabolo and sticks also had to face along the global y-axis.
